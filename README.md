Structure & Colors

Uses CSS variables (:root) for a unified color palette:

--brand: deep red for navbar and buttons

--accent: warm gold for hover highlights

--cream: light creamy background for comfort

--text: main dark text color

   Layout

Applies a full-height flex layout with centered main content.

The background is a smooth cream-to-white gradient for a clean look.

  Navbar

Deep red navigation bar with white text and gold hover underline.

Active links animate smoothly with a yellow underline.

  Form Card

White card box with rounded corners and a soft shadow.

Provides padding, limited width, and elegant spacing for forms.

  Buttons

.btn-brand applies the signature red color with white text.

On hover, the red darkens slightly for visual feedback.

  Calculator & Inputs

.input-big makes input boxes large, centered, and readable.

Smooth focus effects with subtle red glow.

Buttons are enlarged to match input size visually.

  Responsive Design

A media query (@media (min-width: 992px)) limits form width on larger screens to keep layout balanced.

  Footer

Compact red footer with white text, centered alignment, and slightly increased letter spacing.
